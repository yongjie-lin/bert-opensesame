How to generate data:
1) Generate raw examples (which have some additional tags in them, a.g. AUX) from a grammar (here no_agr.gr).
The name of the output should be PREFIX.raw, for some prefix of your choice:
./randsent.sh gr.no_agr 50 > raw.no_agr &

2) Process those examples into training/test/gen sets, where the argument is PREFIX from above (here, no_agr):
python corpusProc.py no_agr

This will generate no_agr.train, no_agr.gen, and no_agr.test.
Note that, to use these, you should shuffle the order of the lines in the file.

The grammar files express PCFGs, where the first element of each row is the weight for that rule (and all weights with a given
left-hand-side will be normalized to get probabilities).
